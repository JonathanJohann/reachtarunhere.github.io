I am Junior year student at BITS Pilani double majoring in Biological Sciences & Electronics-Instrumentation . For the past couple of years I have been involved in Web Development (mainly back-end stuff). At Present, I also lead the technical team for Oasis 2016 (Cultural Festival of BITS Pilani.)

I enjoy contributing to FOSS and have worked with Honeynet as a part of Google Summer of Code 2015. 

More recently I have shifted gears and now I am trying to teach myself selected topics in AI and Computer Vision. Currently *(Dec 2015 - Jan 2016) *I am working with gait data extracted from Kinect at Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute Pilani.

## Blog

The blog is named Stanley as a tribute to [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%28vehicle%29)  the autonomus car which got me interested in CV and ML.
