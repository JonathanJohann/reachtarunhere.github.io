This is just an index of my recommendations for Books, Movies & Articles/Blog Posts on the Internet. Obviouslly the list is incomplete because I am not putting in much effort into moving older stuff here.

#Online Stuff

To be updated after I am done with exams. Most of the stuff here comes from hackernews and reddit though.

#Books

I don't read a lot but I am trying to change that.
### Currently Reading:
- **AIMA 3rd Ed** as a prepratory exercise for GSoC 16.
- **iWoz** - Steve Wozniak's Autobiography. I will resume after the comprees are done. So far the book has maintained a really exciting tone.

### All Time Favourites
- **Surely You are Joking** - Made me realize profs can be cool people too. I have read a couple of more books on Feynman and watched a couple of documentaries. 
- **The Last Lecture** - Prof Randy Pausch managed to change my opinion about several things in life with this little book. I still don't have a clean desk but I now realize the merits of one.


#Movies

Like most BITSians I tend to watch a lot of movies. I use [tastekid](tastekid.com) for movie recommendations. It has functionality to import movies from Facebook which came in pretty handy in my case.

Here goes the list of nice ones I have watched this semester:

- **Million Dollar Baby** - Really inspiring in the beginning but the ending is really sad. Best movie I watched this semester (3-2).
- **Warrior** - Another fighting movie (MMA). I really liked the soundtrack.  The movie has a lot of family drama (which I tend to dislike) and for me the fights were the best part.

I also watched some other among them I would say King's Speech was very average and in my opionion is hyped.

### All Time Favourites:
- **October Sky** - I cry everytime I watch the last scene. Also makes me realize the opportunity I am wasting by not working hard enough at college.
- **Schindler's List** - Got me interested in reading about World War. Great Movie! WARNING: The movie is really sad and graphic.
- **The Pianist** - Same as above.
- **Dead Poet's Society** - Like 3 Idiots but only 100 x better.
