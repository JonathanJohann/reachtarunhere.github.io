Honestly, I am not a big fan of TOI but they are often the top link in Google News for news related to India. I use an adblocker for all websites this has been a source of a little annoyance while visiting their website.

Given their rather poor implementation of this anti ad-blocking system it is a piece of cake to work around it. You do not need to install any extensions.

In Chrome's settings search for "Javascript" and then click "Manage Exceptions". Add their website to the exceptions and select block. That it.
