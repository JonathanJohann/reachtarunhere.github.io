title: ML Notes
---

Hey there! Welcome to the index of my Machine Learning notes. These notes are inspired from the notes at [Hole House](http://holehouse.org/mlclass/index.html). But unlike holehouse notes which have Prof. Ng's class as their main source these notes borrow a material from a lot of sources.

##Why?

I realized that I was reading from a lot of sources and therfore a central repository was required so that I could easily keep track of the stuff. Another reason for their existence is the fact that I stongly believe in the [Feynman Technique](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2014/02/04/learning-on-steroids-with-richard-feynman/) for effectively learning material. These notes are my way of applying it.

##Oops!

While I try my best to be careful with the work that I put in here mistakes **will** happen. This is because I am a beginner in the field and learn most of the material by myself without a formal classroom setting. You can help me by pointing out any mistakes. Please email me with any corrections at reachtarunhere[AT]gmail[DOT]com
